<h1> Obscurify </h1>
<h3> Keeping your secrets ... secret</h3>
Obscurify detects sensitive information on your screen and automatically blurs it when you want to screenshare
<h2> What it does </h2>

Works on both text and images (faces, passwords, names, addresses, etc.).

Uses an agent (with Letta) to retrieve external personal information to hide

Lets users customize additional items theyâ€™d like to hide with a simple checkbox panel.

Uses multiple paths like regex, gemini, and opencv to identify sensitive information

Runs fast enough for real-time conferencing.* 

<h2> To try yourself:</h2>
run the python file obscurify_fast.py with your own GEMINI_API_KEY and LETTA_TOKEN
